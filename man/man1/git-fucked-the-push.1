.SH DESCRIPTION
.B git fucked-the-push
is a destructive recovery helper for the common situation where you made a bad
last commit (for example, a wrong commit message) and pushed it.
.PP
It performs two steps:
.IP \(bu 2
Soft reset the current branch back one commit, keeping the changes staged.
.IP \(bu 2
If the last commit appears on the upstream branch, rewrite the remote using

with
.BR --force-with-lease
so the accidental commit is dropped from the remote branch.

Because it may rewrite published history, do not use this on shared branches
if others may have pulled.
