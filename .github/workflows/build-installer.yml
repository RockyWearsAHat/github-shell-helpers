          body: |
            This release tag (v${{ env.VERSION }}) points at the original commit where the version was first introduced.

            GitHub's auto-generated "Source code" archives reflect that original snapshot and act as a fallback reference.

            The attached installer package (github-shell-helpers-${{ env.VERSION }}.pkg) is rebuilt on each push to main while VERSION=${{ env.VERSION }}, so it always contains the latest fixes for this version line.
